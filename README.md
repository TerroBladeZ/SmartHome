I run HassIO under Docker using IntelÂ® NUC Kit NUC5i5RYK with Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, 16GB RAM and 250GB SSD.
I regularly update my configuration files. If you like anything here, Be sure to ðŸŒŸ my repo!!!!

##### Install HassIO with Docker on ubuntu with just 2 command lines. Thanks to  HASSCASTS.

1. sudo apt-get install curl
2. curl -sL goo.gl/goR2HT | bash -
3. sudo chmod -R 777 /usr/share/hassio

ESP makes dumb wired door sensors to a smart sensor by sending MQTT signals to HA notifing its current state.
The Aura system uses Wifi waves to detect motion through walls.  It covers the entire house.  Scenes are activated via IFTTT/HA integration.

- Shut down HVAC system if a Window or Door is left open for more than 5 minutes.
- Play chime on all window and door open/closes.
- Change Aura scenes based on presence and sleep.
